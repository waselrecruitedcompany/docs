      **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766).

      In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`. 
    - |
      On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories. 
    - | 
      GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily. 
    - |
      On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]

    - |
      Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.

      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.

      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
