**Important**: This feature is currently unavailable. It will be reintroduced in the near future. For more information, see "[Copilot content exclusions â€“ Temporary rollback and upcoming fix](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-11-20-copilot-content-exclusions-temporary-rollback-and-upcoming-fix/)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog.

## About configuring content exclusions

You may want to prevent certain files from being available to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}. You can configure {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} so that it ignores these files. You do this by specifying paths to excluded content in the settings for your repository or organization.

When you specify content exclusions it has two effects:

- The content of the affected files will not be used by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} to inform the code completion suggestions it makes in other files.
- {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} code completion will not be available in the affected files.

{% data reusables.copilot.content-exclusions-delay %} For more information, see "[Propagating content exclusion changes to {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}](#propagating-content-exclusion-changes-to-vs-code)."

### Who is affected by content exclusion settings?

{% data reusables.copilot.content-exclusions-scope %}

All exclusions, whether they are defined in repository settings or in organization settings, apply to all members of the {% ifversion fpt %}organization{% else %}enterprise{% endif %} who have been granted a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seat as part of a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %} subscription. {% ifversion ghec %}This means, for example, that if you are an admin of Organization A, that belongs to Enterprise X, you can set up an exclusion for files in any repositories, hosted on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} or elsewhere, and the exclusion will apply to all {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %} users who belong to an organization in Enterprise X. However, it's recommended that, where an exclusion is being defined for a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository, you should define this either in the settings of that repository, or in the settings for the organization that owns the repository. This makes it easier to identify the exclusions that are in place for a repository than if you define the exclusions in the settings of another organization in the enterprise.{% endif %}

## Configuring content exclusions for your repository

You can use your repository settings to specify content in your repository that {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} should ignore.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
1. In the "Code & automation" section of the side bar, click **{% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" %} {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}**.

   If your repository inherits any exclusions from {%ifversion fpt %}its parent organization{% else %} organizations in the same enterprise{% endif %}, you'll see {%ifversion ghec %}one or more{% else %} a{% endif %} gray box{%ifversion ghec %}es{% endif %} at the top of the page containing details of these exclusions. You cannot edit these settings.

   {%ifversion ghec %}

   {% note %}

   **Note**: Exclusions that affect your repository can be defined in the settings of any organization in your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} enterprise, in addition to those defined in your repository settings.

   {% endnote %}

   {% endif %}

1. In the box under "Paths to exclude in this repository," enter the paths to files from which {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} should be excluded.

   ![Screenshot of the "Paths to exclude" text box in the repository settings for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}.](/assets/images/help/copilot/paths-to-ignore.png)

   Use the format: `- "/PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/OR/FILE"`, with each path on a separate line. You can add comments by starting a line with `#`.

   You can use fnmatch pattern matching notation to specify file paths. For more information, see "[File](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch)" in the ruby-doc.org documentation.

   {% note %}

   **Note**: Patterns are case insensitive.

   {% endnote %}

### Example of paths specified in the repository settings

```yaml annotate
# Ignore the `/src/some-dir/kernel.rs` file in this repository.
- "/src/some-dir/kernel.rs"

# Ignore files called `secrets.json` anywhere in this repository.
- "secrets.json"

# Ignore all files whose names begin `secret` anywhere in this repository.
- "secret*"

# Ignore files whose names end `.cfg` anywhere in this repository.
- "*.cfg"

# Ignore all files in or below the `/scripts` directory of this repository.
- "/scripts/**"
```

## Configuring content exclusions for your organization

You can use your organization settings to specify content, in any repository, that {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} should ignore.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
1. In the left sidebar, click **{% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" %} {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}** then click **Content exclusion**.
1. In the box under "Repositories and paths to exclude," enter details of where {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} should be excluded.

   For each repository in which you want files to be excluded from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}, enter a reference to the repository on one line, followed by paths to locations within the repository, with each path on a separate line. Use the following format:

   ```yaml
   REPOSITORY-REFERENCE:
     - "/PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/OR/FILE"
     - "/PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/OR/FILE"
     - ...
   ```

   The following syntax is supported for `REPOSITORY-REFERENCE`:

   ```text
   http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

   git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

   [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/

   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
   ```

   {% note %}

   **Notes**:

   - The `user@` and `:port` parts of the `REPOSITORY-REFERENCE` are ignored in the calculation of which paths to ignore for a repository.
   - Each repository reference can contain a single `*` wildcard. For example, `https://github.com/octo-org/*` matches all repositories in the `octo-org` organization.

   {% endnote %}

   You can use fnmatch pattern matching notation to specify file paths. For more information, see "[File](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch)" in the ruby-doc.org documentation.

   {% note %}

   **Note**: Patterns are case insensitive.

   {% endnote %}

### Example of repositories and paths in organization settings

```yaml annotate
# Ignore all `.env` files at any path, in any repository.
# This setting applies to all repositories, not just to those on GitHub.com.
# This could also have been written on a single line as:
#
# "*": ["**/.env"]
"*":
  - "**/.env"

# In the `octo-repo` repository in this organization:
octo-repo:
  # Ignore the `/src/some-dir/kernel.rs` file.
  - "/src/some-dir/kernel.rs"

# In the `primer/react` repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}:
https://github.com/primer/react.git:
  # Ignore files called `secrets.json` anywhere in this repository.
  - "secrets.json"
  # Ignore files called `temp.rb` in or below the `/src` directory.
  - "/src/**/temp.rb"

# In the `copilot` repository of any {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization:
git@github.com:*/copilot:
  # Ignore any files in or below the `/__tests__` directory.
  - "/__tests__/**"
  # Ignore any files in the `/scripts` directory.
  - "/scripts/*"

# In the `gitlab-org/gitlab-runner` repository on GitLab:
git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/gitlab-runner.git:
  # Ignore the `/main_test.go` file.
  - "/main_test.go"
  # Ignore any files with names beginning `server` or `session`, anywhere in this repository.
  - "{server,session}*"
  # Ignore any files with names ending `.md` or `.mk`, anywhere in this repository.
  - "*.m[dk]"
  # Ignore files directly within directories such as `packages` or `packaged`, anywhere in this repository.
  - "**/package?/*"
  # Ignore files in or below any `security` directories, anywhere in this repository.
  - "**/security/**"
```

## Reviewing changes to the content exclusion settings

If you are an organization owner, you can check any changes that have been made to content exclusions.

1. Open the "Content exclusion" page in the settings for your organization ([described here](#configuring-content-exclusions-for-your-organization)), or the settings for a repository ([described here](#configuring-content-exclusions-for-your-repository)).
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page.

   You will see the name of the person who last changed the settings, and information about when they made this change.

1. Click the time of the last change.

   ![Screenshot of the last edited information. The time of change link is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/copilot/content-exclusions-last-edited-by.png)

   {% note %}

   **Note**: The time of the last change is only a link if you are an organization owner.

   {% endnote %}

   The "Audit log" page for the organization is displayed, showing the most recently logged occurrences of the `copilot.content_exclusion_changed` action.

   If you clicked through from a repository settings page, the audit log is filtered to show only changes to content exclusions for that repository.

1. Click the ellipsis (...) at the end of each entry to see more details.

   If the "excluded_paths" entry is truncated, hover over the truncated value to show the full entry. This displays the content of the exclusion settings after the change was saved.

   ![Screenshot of audit log details for the 'copilot.content_exclusion_changed' action. The ellipsis button is highlighted.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-audit-log.png)

## Checking the effect of a settings change

When you change {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s content exclusions you can check that the setting blocks {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} from suggesting code in the specified files.

1. In {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}, open a file that you expect to be affected by your content exclusions.

   If a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} content exclusion applies to this file, the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} icon in the status bar has a diagonal line through it.

   ![Screenshot of the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} disabled icon in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} toolbar.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-disabled-for-repo.png)

1. Click the icon to see a dropdown menu with information about the content exclusions that apply to this file.

   ![Screenshot of the dropdown menu showing why a file has been excluded from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-disabled-for-this-file.png)

   {% note %}

   **Note**: Clicking **Open logs** in this menu displays the log for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} in which details of all excluded files you open are recorded.

   {% endnote %}

1. You can confirm that {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is disabled for this file by starting to type a line of code, such as a comment. Normally you would see a code completion suggestion from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} as you type. However, if this file is affected by a content exclusions setting you will not see any suggestions.

### Propagating content exclusion changes to {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}

If you opened a file in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} before you changed the content exclusions, you may need to reload the window in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} to see the effect of the settings change.

1. Access the Command Palette. For example, by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows/Linux).
1. Type: `reload`.
1. Select **Developer: Reload Window**.
